Introduction to Binary Trees:

Binary Tree has basically 0, 1, 2 child.

Properties of Binary Tree:

1. The node at the top of the tree is called the Root node.
2. Nodes that do not have any child nodes are called leaf nodes.

Types of Binary Tree:

1. FULL BINARY TREE
In a full binary tree, every node except the leaves has exactly two children.

2. COMPLETE BINARY TREE
In a complete binary tree, every level of the tree is completely filled except for the last level, which can be partially filled.

3. PERFECT BINARY TREE
Leaf nodes are present at the same level.

4. BALANCED BINARY TREE 
Height of the tree => log(Nodes)

5. DEGENERATE TREE 
They basically skewed trees
